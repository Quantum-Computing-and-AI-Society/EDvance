# EDVerse-Paper checking and Grade Assigning AI Model
A free grade assigning AI where the user can upload his/her solved pastpaper. The AI will check and mark the answers on the same criteria that Cambridge would check and mark the answers. The final grade that the AI would assign should be the same or very close to the grade a Cambridge examiner would assign.
Problem we are solving
•	Recently the Cambridge released the individual component marks and there was a clear disparity the marks a student would consistently score in school and the marks Cambridge assigned him.
•	O/Alevel is costly. With this AI we aim to enable a person to give his cie and score a good grade using free online resources and our AI without the need for expensive tuitions and schools.
