# EDVerse-Paper checking and Grade Assigning AI Model
A free grade assigning AI where the user can upload his/her solved pastpaper. The AI will check and mark the answers on the same criteria that Cambridge would check and mark the answers. The final grade that the AI would assign should be the same or very close to the grade a Cambridge examiner would assign.

Problems we are solving:
1) Recently the Cambridge released the individual component marks and there was a clear disparity the marks a student would consistently score in school and the marks Cambridge assigned him.
2) O/Alevel is costly. With this AI we aim to enable a person to give his cie and score a good grade using free online resources and our AI without the need for expensive tuitions and schools.

Endpoint: 
The user will be able to freely access the model through our AI model website and mobile app.

Current scope of our Project:
Currently we will be tackling Paper 1 of computer science. Our model will be able to check all past papers from 2021 to may june 2024 of all variants(constituting 21 papers in total).

Must have features:
1) Update our model to tackle recent past papers e.g 2025 m/j past papers when they become available
2) Ability to understand diagrams, drawings, etc
3) Ability to identify sentences/ words cut by the user and to treat part of the answer in answer space provided and on the extra sheet as one answer
4) Scalable enough to be applied to other subjects
5) Hand writing recognition abilities
6) Model should act differently for different subjects.e.g for economics focus more on economic terms, applications of economic concepts. While for english essays should focus more on writing style, register,prose, etc
7) Model should output to user other past paper question relating to the same concept they are weak in
8) AI model should output some motivational sentences and study tips for the user after marking the paper

Possible features we would like to have:
1) Confidence scores: how much confident is the model in the marks it assigned
2) Feedback on areas and topics that need improvement, why marks were deducted
3) Suggestions on how to better write/phrase answers 
4) Explanation of concepts that were weak
5) Scalability enough that we can output ai generated questions/ give user another past paper question relating to the same concept they are weak in.
6) Model light weight enough to be implemented as edge AI but performance still at par with top tier llms
